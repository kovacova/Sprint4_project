Analysis of Titanic Passenger Data
Project Description:
This project is an analysis of the passenger data from the Titanic disaster in 1912. The data includes information about each passenger, suchas: age, gender, class, and fare, as well as whether they survived or not. We will explore the data and gain insights on factors that may have influenced survival rates.
